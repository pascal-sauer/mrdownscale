#' calcLandInput
#'
#' Prepare the land input data for the category mapping, checking data for consistency before returning.
#' All "Land" functions deal with area data, as opposed to "Nonland" functions which deal with non-area
#' data such as the amount of applied fertilizer. These are treated differently, because for area
#' data other constraints apply, e.g. the total area must be constant over time.
#'
#' input = "magpie": includes the land use categories
#' past (pasture, including rangeland), forestry (managed forest),
#' primforest, secdforest, urban, other (other land) and many
#' specific crop types. Furthermore, 1st gen biofuel is
#' added and filled with zeros. 1st gen biofuel is only modeled implicitly in
#' magpie via demand, and because of trade it is unclear on what area 1st gen
#' biofuel is grown, also 1st gen biofuel is quickly phased out in magpie, so
#' we fill biofuel_1st_gen with zeros and rely on the harmonization to produce
#' a plausible 1st gen biofuel time series.
