#' toolTransitionsBasic
#'
#' tool function to extract transitions between categories from a land
#' data set with at least 2 time steps. The approach is rather simplistic by
#' assuming that expansion happens proportionally in all affected classes (equal
#' preference of transitions across all categories).
#'
#' In addition to the net effect it can also estimate gross transition. For that
#' purpose a reference data set containing bidirectional transition shares
#' must be provided.
#'
#' If the time step length is longer than 1 year the returned object contains
#' reference years for each period which can be repeated to retrieve the
#' full transition between two time periods, e.g. if you provide two time steps
#' 2000 and 2005 the return value will be the transition for year 2001. Repeating
#' the same transition also in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 will give the full
#' transition from 2000 to 2005.
#'
#' @param x magpie data set containing land data with at least two time steps
#' to extract net transitions from
#' @param gross either boolean or a magpie object containing bidirectional
#' transition shares relative to the area of the involved land pools (transition
#' divided by the area of the land pool in the "from" sub dimension). If set to
#' FALSE only net transitions will be returned. If set to TRUE an internal
#' gross transition estimate based on average gross transitions in LUH2 in the
#' period from 1995 to 2015 will be used.
