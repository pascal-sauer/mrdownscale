calcLandTransitions(
  outputFormat,
  input,
  harmonizationPeriod,
  yearsSubset,
  harmonization,
  downscaling,
  gross
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outputFormat}{format in which the outputs should be prepared. Currently,
only "ESM" for earth system model compatible input data is available.}

\item{input}{name of an input dataset, currently only "magpie"}

\item{harmonizationPeriod}{Two integer values, before the first given
year the target dataset is used, after the second given year the input
dataset is used, in between harmonize between the two datasets}

\item{yearsSubset}{vector of years to keep in the output dataset}

\item{harmonization}{name of harmonization method, see \code{\link{toolGetHarmonizer}}}

\item{downscaling}{name of downscaling method, currently only "magpieClassic"}

\item{gross}{either boolean or a magpie object containing bidirectional
transition shares relative to the area of the involved land pools (transition
divided by the area of the land pool in the "from" sub dimension). If set to
FALSE only net transitions will be returned. If set to TRUE an internal
gross transition estimate based on average gross transitions in LUH2 in the
period from 1995 to 2015 will be used.}
