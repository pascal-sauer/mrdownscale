\description{
Harmonize wood harvest area based on harmonized land data.
First, wood harvest area is harmonized just like land data.
Then, to ensure consistency, primary harvest is converted to seondary
harvest (or vice versa) to match the primary land reduction from the
harmonized land data. If secondary harvest exceeds the available
secondary land, the excess is shifted to the other secondary land
(secdf to secdn and vice versa). Remaining excess harvest area is reported.
